Predicting Spatial DNA Methylation

Introduction:
DNA methylation has been extensively linked to alterations in gene expression, playing a key role in the
manifestation of multiple diseases. Hence, the sequence determinants of methylation and the relationship
between methylation and expression are of great interest from a biological perspective.
Several models have been suggested to support the prediction of methylation status. These models,
however, were never tested on spatial data. In this project, we will take an existing DNA methylation model
that was developed on non-spatial data, and use it to predict spatial DNA methylation.
DNA Methylation: DNA methylation is a chemical process that modifies DNA in living organisms and can
significantly affect gene expression, mostly through the inhibition transcription. In humans, DNA
methylation refers to the presence of a methyl group at a defined position of cytosine and occurs mostly
in CpG dinucleotides. It has been particularly shown to affect gene expression in gene promoter regions
with relatively dense CpGs, known as CpG islands (CGI). When a large number of proximal CpGs are
methylated, the transcription of nearby downstream genes may be inhibited. DNA methylation plays a key
role in disease development.
